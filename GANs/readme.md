# Generative Adversial Networks or GANs

GANs are generative models which are used to generate fake things such as images, audio and videos. GANs contain two neural networks the Generator and the Discriminator. Generator generates new random data patterns whereas the discriminator checks classifies the data pattern generated by discriminator as real (belonging to the original training set) or fake.

The name adversarial came because the two networks generator and discriminator works in a conflicting or opposite manner. Main aim of generator is to fool discriminator.

## How does it work?
GANs consists of two networks, a Generator G(x), and a Discriminator D(x). They both play an adversarial game where the generator tries to fool the discriminator by generating data similar to those in the training set. The Discriminator tries not to be fooled by identifying fake data from real data. They both work simultaneously to learn and train complex data like audio, video or image files.

## Math
The Discriminator and Generator play a two-player minimax game with the value function V(G, D). So, Minimax Objective function is:

D() gives us the probability that the given sample is from training data X. For the Generator, we want to minimize log(1-D(G(z)) i.e. when the value of D(G(z)) is high then D will assume that G(z) is nothing but X and this makes 1-D(G(z)) very low and we want to minimize it which this even lower. For the Discriminator, we want to maximize D(X) and (1-D(G(z))). So the optimal state of D will be P(x)=0.5. However, we want to train the generator G such that it will produce the results for the discriminator D so that D wonâ€™t be able to distinguish between z and X.

### Why are our results not this good?

The authors of the paper  introduced numerous optimization
techniques (mostly regularization) which improves the generated images(with alot of noise) to a clear image
